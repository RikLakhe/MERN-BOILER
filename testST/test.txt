internal demo in 20march,2020

total working days 30 days excluding sundays... 7 weeks


incase of transaction the is one to one transaction sender and reciever, 
but we want a node *(HUB) where multiple sender to multiple reciever, this is a remmitance platform
what does this platform doese: QFX 
qfx is a platfrom for movies 
similar type is our remitance, send money from other country to nepal
Simly, a person goes to remitance agent, he ask just where and how. he can choose from multiple remitance system.

remithub manages multiple MTO multiple Transaction Operator. when a new agent want to get into the remitance he will enroll into remithub  as sender or reciever, he doesnot have to spend time to handle look for sender be will only handle the recieving agents.

MTO easy to access and can handle as much MTO transactions, 10000 per day transaction in CITYExpress
KYC different by country and county
WesternUnion internal law states that they dont allow transaction with donation heading... reason Famouse Bangladesh bank hack
platform that will obey MTO rules and regulation and they obey ours, so a configurable dynamic platform needed.

process,
MTO joins our system, theis MTO needs to register in certain country. will register in our system

in a platform for a transaction, sender detail and reciewver detail is dynamic but also MTO detail and Transaction detail which is from system

AML - rules regulating transaction in countries
what confuguration we wanted AML cannot be applied by just custom fields so we are adding KYC Builder,
we need to extend our configuration so comes the HOOK URL, eg 
aust to nepal, from remithub AUS 500 , we can cash out as per rule
aust to nepal, from remithub AUS more than 500 it should go through bank,
suppose, mega bank to mega bank transaction to person ac 1234 suraj but the person makes a mistake 1233 suraj, this can happen
we need to customize in level of banks too, added hook to add another check parameter like phone number too for this bank only not on cityremits
